## North star

Ship a cozy frontier eco-sim where settlers live on a schedule, the food chain matters, and the valley feels alive — **without asking players to touch a terminal**.

**Winning moment for a new player:** *"I built a house, assigned workers, didn't kill all the wolves, and everyone came home at night."*

---

## Timeline

### June 21 — Early alpha foundation

**Goal:** Take the ecosystem settlement sim from prototype toward a playtestable early alpha.

| Area | What shipped |
|------|----------------|
| **Branding** | `GAME_PHASE = 'Early Alpha'`; badges in header, intro, Guide |
| **Humans** | Movement fixes (no ice-skating); procedural 4-frame walk sheets (`humanSprites.ts`) |
| **Social** | Speech bubbles (`humanChat.ts`); day/night schedule (`dayCycle.ts`) — 24 ticks = 1 day |
| **Housing** | `residenceBuildingId` for sleep; `homeBuildingId` = workplace (legacy name) |
| **World** | Visitor caravans + rival camps (`groupEvents.ts`); Moon Howlers + Church cure |
| **UX** | Collapsible build panel, Inspector, Guide tab, `IntroScreen.tsx` |
| **Audio** | Procedural music/SFX rewrite; `beginAudio()` unlock on user gesture; mute persists |
| **Docs** | `README.md`, `app/README.md`, `TECHNICAL.md`, `ROADMAP.md` split |
| **Dev** | Root `package.json` — `npm start` / `npm run build` from repo root |

**Assessment (end of day):** ~6.5/10 playtest alpha — strong vision, polish still catching up.

---

### June 24 — v2.2 playtest pass (session eecca284)

| Item | Change |
|------|--------|
| **First-night tutorial** | Quick Start warns build House before tick 24; amber banner ticks 18–30 |
| **Save migration** | `GAME_VERSION` → `2.2`; calendar normalization on load |
| **Terrain placement** | Block water, mountains, snow; allow grass, forest, hills, etc. |
| **Victory scope** | Goals tab: Eco-Utopia + Great City active; Trade + Harmony "coming soon" |
| **Balance** | Starting food 530; 1 wolf; `foodSpoilageRate` 0.03 |
| **Human sprites** | PNG preload; idle = static PNG, moving = walk frames |
| **Desktop** | `desktop:note` stub only (no full Tauri yet) |

**Build:** `npm run build` + `npm run lint` — pass.

---

### June 24 — Sprite & interaction fixes

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Humans looked like "only heads" | Full-body PNG for idle + moving; procedural fallback only |
| Style switched while walking | Same PNG path for both states |
| Settlers gigantic vs world | Reduced `HUMAN_DRAW_SCALE`, `HUMAN_SPRITE_HEIGHT_MULT`, `HUMAN_MIN_SCREEN_PX` |
| Clicks missed settlers | `getHumanSelectionBounds()` from real sprite bounds |
| Houses showed "+ Worker" | Hidden for residences; guard in `assignIdleWorkerToBuilding()` |
| Speed 3x/5x felt weak | Added 10x speed option (`SPEED_OPTIONS` in `App.tsx`) |

**Files:** `humanSprites.ts`, `renderer.ts`, `spriteLoader.ts`, `App.tsx`, `gameEngine.ts`, `gameLoop.ts`

---

### June 25 — Event log overhaul + Prison building + terrain fix

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| **Event log storage** | Removed the 500-entry cap; the save now keeps **all** events forever |
| **Event log UI** | In-game panel still shows the latest 500 for performance; footer shows total stored count |
| **Event log exports** | Added **.json** and **.csv** raw-data exports alongside the existing readable **.txt** chronicle; exports include the full history |
| **Prison building** | New Community building (unlocks with Architecture research); uses custom `jail.png` sprite; requires a manually assigned **Guard** |
| **Arrests** | Caught adulterers can be arrested and sentenced to 2.5–6 in-game days per staffed Prison |
| **Prisoners** | Can't work, move, have affairs, or be reassigned while imprisoned; released automatically when sentence ends |
| **Prison UI** | Prison panel lists current prisoners + days left; entity panel shows imprisonment status; population badge/overview show "jailed" count |
| **Terrain rendering** | Fixed terrain cache size mismatch that made maps look "mangled" and blurry; tiles now render 1:1 with the world grid |
| **Terrain presets** | Increased differences between Verdant / Mountainous / Coastal / Arid / Harsh so maps actually look distinct |

**Build:** `npm run build` + `npm run lint` — pass.

---

Major gameplay fixes from extended playtesting (~200 pop sims, 30-min runs):

| Area | Fixes |

| **Food** | Meals at 8am & 6pm only; pregnancy 5 days / cooldown 8 days |
| **Workshop** | Recipes, staffing, calendar timers, challenge AND logic |
| **Town Hall** | `architecture_2` unlock chain; research sync on load; Community tab first |
| **Housing** | Cap 6 slots; Expand (+2); family stays with parents; mansion 8 |
| **Commute** | Worker snap at 7am/7pm + distance-scaled rush |
| **Event log** | 500 cap; scrollable Log tab; filters, copy, Download .txt; export on Save |
| **Purpose UX** | `focusHints.ts`, `FocusPanel.tsx`; guide + diplomacy button updates |
| **Weapons** | Defense research + Blacksmith for iron; armament checklist in Village tab |
| **Rivals** | Basic diplomacy: gift, trade pact, show strength (`groupEvents.ts`) |
| **Other** | Demolish completed houses; married-to label; barn vs silo clarity |

**Sims:** `npm run simulate:30min` from repo root.

| Area | What shipped |
|------|----------------|
| **UI/UX** | 6-tab sidebar, `AlertBar`, `BuildHotbar`, `FrontierPanel`, `ChallengesPanel`, tab hotkeys, focus Go → |
| **Forge** | `villageForge` queue — iron spears/shields need staffed Blacksmith forge run |

| Headless sim (72k ticks) | Pass — avg **1.81 ms/tick**, ~557 entities, ~8 game years |

**Lint fixes:** removed unused `countByType` in `simulate-30min.ts`; inspector auto-expand moved from `useEffect` to selection handlers in `App.tsx`.

---

### July 4, 2026 — Comprehensive bug-fix pass (~40 fixes)

Four code-review rounds across `app/src/` (game, components, `App.tsx`). Full table in [app/CHANGELOG.md](app/CHANGELOG.md) → **Bug fixes — comprehensive pass**.

| **1** | Core sim + loop | Map setup GameLoop sync; faction ages; double aging; winter heating; prison demolish; challenges/eco timing; placement; raid defend; guard constant |
| **2** | Frontier + economy | Diplomacy event loss; peace vs raids; rival pop; workshop gold cap; `great_city`; victory buildings; prison ghost workers; eco health |
| **3** | Calendar + save | Eco 24×/year; age display; raid tick timing; save year sync; trade storage cap; forge tick; leadership XP |
| **4** | Visitors + stats | Refugees killed on departure; pop-cap food charge; save migrations; stats births/disasters; diplomacy/trade/forge UI feedback; moon howler hunt leak |

**Verification (`/check-work`):**

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|

| `npm run lint` | **0 errors** (3 pre-existing hook warnings in `App.tsx`) |
| `npm run simulate` | Pass |
| `npm run simulate:30min` | Pass (~102s) |

**Post-check-work fixes:** `getAgeInYears(entity)` signature cleanup; yearly `humanBirths` uses `birthYear === state.year`.

---

### June 24 — Code cleanup (hygiene only)

No intended gameplay changes. See [app/CHANGELOG.md](app/CHANGELOG.md) for detail.

| Change | Files |
|--------|-------|
| Shared event log module | **New** `eventLog.ts` — `logEvent`, `EVENT_LOG_MAX`, `syncEventLogIdFromState` |
| Deduped visitor/rival logging | `groupEvents.ts` dropped `pushLog` / `logSeq` |
| Victory constants together | `COMING_SOON_VICTORY_PATHS` moved to `victory.ts` |
| Consolidated imports | `App.tsx` combat helpers via `gameEngine` re-exports |

**Deferred:** split `gameEngine.ts` (~3,700 lines); unify `pushNews`/`addBigNews`; prune unused shadcn UI scaffold.

## Build status

```bash
cd D:\Kimi_Agent_Update_Building_Background_Colors
npm start              # dev server → http://127.0.0.1:5173
npm run build          # tsc + vite — passes
npm run lint           # ESLint — 0 errors, 3 hook warnings (July 2026)
npm run simulate:30min # headless sim — env SIM_MINUTES, PERF_SAMPLE_EVERY
```

---

## Architecture notes

- `homeBuildingId` = **workplace**; `residenceBuildingId` = house/mansion for sleep
- `RenderSnapshot` separates sim from view; renderer is read-only
- Save versions: `COMPATIBLE_SAVE_VERSIONS` includes `2.0`–`2.2`, `0.4`, `0.4.1`, `0.4.2`
- Multiplayer later: `faction`, `groupId` on entities prototyped for visitors/rivals
- Iron spears/shields need Defense research **and** `villageForge` forge run at staffed Blacksmith
- Event log uncapped in saves; UI shows latest 500 entries

---

## What's not done (see ROADMAP)

**v0.4.2 ship checklist — closed 2026-07-05** (tag `v0.4.2`, `GAME_VERSION = 0.4.2`).
